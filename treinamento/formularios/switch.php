ExercÃ­cio 4 http://phpexercises.com/php-switch-statement-exercise.html

You probably noticed that the if-elseif-else construction was repetitive and cumbersome in the last exercise. It works best with only one or two choices. A more appropriate construction for this exercise is the switch statement, combined with a select field in the form for the days of the week. So your assignment in this PHP exercise is to rewrite the previous exercise using a select field for the user input and the switch statement to process the response.

Once again, here's the poem:

Laugh on Monday, laugh for danger. 
Laugh on Tuesday, kiss a stranger. 
Laugh on Wednesday, laugh for a letter.
Laugh on Thursday, something better.
Laugh on Friday, laugh for sorrow.
Laugh on Saturday, joy tomorrow.

Remember to include a general response for any input that is not in the poem. To make things a little more interesting, include a 'Back' button on the response so that the user can go back and try different days.
